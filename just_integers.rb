a = 12
b = 65
c = 31
d = 98

#Write code to find the average of these numbers
(a + b + c + d)/4 # returns 51

# On paper, sum of a - d is 206. Divided by 4 that gives us 51.5
# The difference bewteen paper on code is that my code is giving me an iteger
# not a float

# What result do you get out from Ruby when the following is entered?
a + b * c / d # => 32
# if you add 1 pair of parentheses...
(a + b) * c / d #= 24
# or ...
a + b * (c / d) #= 12
